# MNIST Digit Recognition

A Model Zoo applied to the MNIST digit recognition problem.

This repository containts a selection of possible ways to tackle the MNIST Digit Recognition problem with
different frameworks and with different models.

Some effort was made to make the implementation in different frameworks as similar as possible.
